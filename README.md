# Data-698 Final Project

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal imbalance disorder affecting women of reproductive age. The exact number of women affected by PCOS worldwide is difficult to determine as many cases go undiagnosed but according to the World Health Organization (WHO), there's 3.4% of women who are affected [1].  It may not seem as much, but women make up 49.7% of the todayâ€™s population [2], almost 13% of those women are of reproductive age [3], leaving about 17.5 million women who reported to suffer from PCOS. Aside from the toll PCOS takes on your physical and emotional health, it causes problems in the ovaries, making it difficult for women to have a healthy menstrual cycle leading to the development of cysts and infertility. It's important to note that the prevalence of PCOS varies by region and ethnic groups, with some studies suggesting higher rates of PCOS in certain populations [4]. This project will investigate publicly available datasets that will allow us to create predictive models on markers in routine test results to make a diagnosis.
